# Employee Directory Application

![Example 1](./searchDemo.gif) 

A frontend React.js application that programmatically sorts information about employees. The application's core focus is to view non-sensitive data about other employees in the organization. 

## Website Example

* http://eurbaezjr.github.io/react-employee-directory

## Functionality & User Input

* The application has a search bar input field that allows the user to quickly search for any employee name, occupation and location in the organization. As an example, I used a series of cartoon characters.

* Created modular react classes and functional components to allow for scalability.

## Installing Instructions

* In the root of the folder, there is a `package.json`, so make sure to `npm install`.

* The dependencies are, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) 

### Roster output

The application solely returns items to the user that match the search.

  * Name

  * Role

  * Location
